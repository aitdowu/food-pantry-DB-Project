This is my Food Pantry Tracker project for Databases. To execute this, you need to first run the file called app.js; this is the backend. After you run that, run the frontend by
opening an integrated terminal and entering "npm start". This will allow you to run the program on the local host. From there, you can experiment with the program and make any database
additions, updates, deletions, etc that you like to test the program.
